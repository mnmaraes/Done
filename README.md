# Done

An example app of my new development workflow.

It follows the simple rules:

1. (Independently) work on one layer at a time
2. Work on Controllers/ViewModels/etc. last.
3. Test Independently
4. Don't start until you know what needs to be done.

# What Needs To Be Done

1. Create A Bare-Bones Workspace
    1. View, Model and ViewModel Projects
    2. Basic Testing Setup
2. Create A Simple To Do App
